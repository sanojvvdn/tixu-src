Build and boot in *N*-steps
===========================

1. Check `required host packages`_ for your Linux Distribution

2. Download the `repo`_ tool::

    $ mkdir -p ~/bin
    $ PATH=~/bin:${PATH}
    $ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo 
    $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

3. Download the Yocto's Metadata::

    $ mkdir fsl-community-bsp # You can name it anything you want
    $ cd fsl-community-bsp
    fsl-community-bsp $ repo init \
                            -u https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform \
                            -b jethro
    fsl-community-bsp $ repo sync 

4. Select your machine (:ref:`machines`) and prepare the environment for bitbake::

    fsl-community-bsp $ MACHINE=<selected machine> source ./setup-environment build
    build $

5. Select your image (:ref:`images`) and build::

    build $ bitbake-layers show-recipes "*image*" | grep ':'  # To list all possible images
    build $ bitbake <selected image>	# Bake! The first time can take several hours

6. Flash your SD card::

    # Insert your SD Card
    # Type '$ dmesg | tail' to see the device node being used, e.g /dev/sdb
    # In case the SD to be flashed has already some partitions, the host system may have 
    # mounted these, so unmount them, e.g. '$ sudo umount /dev/sdb?'.
    build $ ls -la 'tmp/deploy/images/<selected machine>/*.sdcard'

    # Flash the soft link one
    build $ sudo dd if=tmp/deploy/images/<selected machine>/<selected image>-<selected machine>.sdcard \
                    of=/dev/sdX \
                    bs=1M \
                    conv=fsync

7. Place your SD Card in the correct board's slot and boot!
